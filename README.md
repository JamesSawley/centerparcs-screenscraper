# centerparcs-screenscraper
This repo is for people who have a 'come back soon' deal on Centerparcs, but are too lazy to check the site everyday. There is a little upfront effort required, but once you've configured this node.js app, you can sit back and wait for the savings to come rolling in :pound: :pound: :pound:.
